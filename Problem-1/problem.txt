You are given an array of integers A and an integer X.
Your task is to find the number of triplets (i,j,k) where 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n such that 
A[i]⊕A[j]⊕A[k]=X (where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation).

Input:
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains n integers A[i] (0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^6) — the elements of the array.
The third line contains an integer X (0 ≤ X ≤ 10^6).

Output:
A single integer representing the number of triplets (i,j,k) such that A[i]⊕A[j]⊕A[k]=X.
